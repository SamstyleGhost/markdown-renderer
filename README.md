## Working on this I guess

v2:
- Currently has support for p, h1 and h2 elements on different blocks using '\n' as the separator
- Can optimize the way blocks are updated because in React, this would rerender everytime I feel like

v3:
- Changed the look of the site
- To add the bold and italic stuff next
